## Project Title 
Topics 

## Description
The task is to build a React web application that displays all the "topics"related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API. 
The application should display how many "stargazers" each topic has. 
A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have.


## Technologies Used:
Vite - To create the application. It is highly performant.
React - Used react to build components, mostly function based components are used.
MaterialUI- Used material ui for styling.Css-in-js is used for styling. 
@apollo/client - Used to integrate graphQL features

## Setup/Installation:
### Install Vite Globally
npm install -g vite 
### Install node modules 
npm install 

## Approach: 
--> Used Vite to create the project - Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
--> The design pattern used is "The compound components pattern" - The compound components pattern provides an expressive and flexible API for communication between a parent component and its children. Also, the compound components pattern enables a parent component to interact and share state with its children implicitly, which makes it suitable for building declarative UI.
--> Adopted Material ui way of styling css-in-js for styling
